## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project gave me more practice with using mix-blend-mode in css as well as pseudo classes of ::after. Additionally, this was my first time setting up a lightbox modal system. I also learned how to set up a hamburger menu for mobile displays which expands into desktop.

### Continued development

For continued development I would like to make the expansion of the hamburger menu with a smooth animation as well as having that on slideshow pictures when they change.
